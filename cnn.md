# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture
## Overview
A CNN is a type of neural network that uses small filters to scan input data, such as images.

### Key Components
* Convolutional layers: apply filters to the input data
depthwise separable convolution for reducing parameters and computation
depthwise convolution for improving performance on deeper networks
* Pooling layers: downsample spatial dimensions to reduce complexity of the network
## Applications
Image classification
Object detection
Image segmentation
